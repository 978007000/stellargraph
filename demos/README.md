## Table of Contents

This folder contains several examples of applying machine learning algorithms on graph-structured
data to solve several common problems including node attribute inference and link prediction. The
examples demonstrate using the StellarGraph library on both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks.

Each folder contains one or more examples of using the StellarGraph implementations of the
state-of-the-art algorithms, GraphSAGE [3], HinSAGE, Node2Vec [1], and Metapath2Vec [2]. 
GraphSAGE and HinSAGE are methods based on graph convolutional neural networks. Node2Vec and
Metapath2Vec are methods based on graph random walks and representation learning using the
Word2Vec [4] algorithm.

- GraphSAGE and HinSAGE: ensure that a MLP can be created by using zero samples [\#301](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/301)
- Handle isolated nodes in GraphSAGE [\#294](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/294)
- Ensure isolated nodes are handled correctly by GraphSAGENodeMapper and GraphSAGELinkMapper [\#182](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/182)
- EdgeSplitter: introduce a switch for keeping the reduced graph connected [\#285](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/285)
- Node2vec for weighted graphs [\#241](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/241)
- Fix edge types in demos [\#237](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/237)
- Add docstrings to StellarGraphBase class [\#175](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/175)
- Make L2-normalisation of the final embeddings in GraphSAGE and HinSAGE optional [\#115](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/115)
- Check/change the GraphSAGE mapper's behaviour for isolated nodes [\#100](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/100)
- Added GraphSAGE node embedding extraction and visualisation [\#290](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/290)

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fixed the bug in running demos when no options given [\#271](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/271)
- Fixed the bug in LinkSequence that threw an error when no link targets were given [\#273](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/273)

**Refactoring:**
- Refactored link inference classes to use `edge_embedding_method` instead of `edge_feature_method` [\#327](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/327)
